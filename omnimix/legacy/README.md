## convert_omni

This tool converts the v1 omnimix_data_install folder into a proper data_mods/omnimix song pack.

Usage:
  1. Place `omnimix_data_install` and `tools` folder from the omnimix v1 archive in the same folder as the script.
  2. Run `convert_omnimix.bat`
  
The generated `data_mods` folder is now suitable to use with omnimix v2, copy it to your pop'n music "contents" folder along with the omnimix_v2 archive contents.
